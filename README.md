# Carbon Factory

Tools to help create user interfaces with [Carbon](https://github.com/sage/carbon) and [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/).

Carbon Factory has two main functions:

* A command line interface to more easily scaffold new projects and components - ensure you have the latest version of the CLI by installing Carbon Factory globally:
```
npm install sage/carbon-factory -g
```
* Tasks for compiling your code and running tests in your project - to use these tasks you need to include Carbon Factory as a dev dependency in your project:
```
npm install sage/carbon-factory --save-dev
```

## Setup

First of all ensure you have gone through the [first time installation guide](docs/first-time-installation.md), which will guide you through preparing your development environment.
